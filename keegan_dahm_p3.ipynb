This classic dataset contains over 8000 examples, where each describes a mushroom by a variety of features like color, odor, etc., and the target variable is an indicator for whether the mushroom is poisonous. The feature space has been binarized. Look at the feature_names below to see all 126 binary names.\n","\n","You'll start by running PCA to reduce the dimensionality from 126 down to 2 so that you can easily visualize the data. In general, PCA is very useful for visualization (though sklearn.manifold.tsne is known to produce better visualizations). Recall that PCA is a linear transformation. The 1st projected dimension is the linear combination of all 126 original features that captures as much of the variance in the data as possible. The 2nd projected dimension is the linear combination of all 126 original features that captures as much of the remaining variance as possible. The idea of dense low dimensional representations is crucial to machine learning!\n","\n","Once you've projected the data to 2 dimensions, you'll experiment with clustering using k-means and density estimation with Gaussian mixture models (GMM). Finally, you'll train a classifier by fitting a GMM for the positive class and a GMM for the negative class, and perform inference by comparing the probabilities output by each model.\n","\n","As always, you're welcome to work on the project in groups and discuss ideas on the course wall, but please **prepare your own write-up and write your own code**."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YDvuh15loZG2"},"source":["%matplotlib inline\n","\n","import urllib.request as urllib2 # For python3\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn import metrics\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n","from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture\n","from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"JKyn8WO1pJwK"},"source":["MUSHROOM_DATA = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCB-MIDS/207-Applied-Machine-Learning/master/Data/mushroom.data'\n","MUSHROOM_MAP = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCB-MIDS/207-Applied-Machine-Learning/master/Data/mushroom.map'"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"28FIvBtVoZG4"},"source":["Load feature names."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zXUv_S1YoZG4"},"source":["feature_names = []\n","\n","for line in urllib2.urlopen(MUSHROOM_MAP):\n","    [index, name, junk] = line.decode('utf-8').split()\n","    feature_names.append(name)\n","\n","print('Loaded feature names: ', len(feature_names))\n","print(feature_names)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"k034gVFboZHA"},"source":["Load data.
